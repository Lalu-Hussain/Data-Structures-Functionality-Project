This is a Project about Data Structures Functionalty like a array to store tasks, allowing for quick access to specific tasks using indices, stack organizes data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) fashion, while a queue uses a first-in, first-out (FIFO) approach,Single linked list to allow dynamic insertion and deletion of tasks at any position and Double linked list enhance task management with bidirectional links, supporting backward and forward traversal and Enable more flexible navigation and manipulation of tasks.These organizations make it easier to model and solve specific problems efficiently.
